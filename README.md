# UFOs

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to develop a webpage presentation of data regarding UFO sitings.

## Results
The data compiled consists of one hundred and eleven records. Multiple filter methods were applied to the webpage so that visitors to the site are capable of filtering the data table down to data that is relevant or specific to their interests. Within each record of the data is a description of the siting which allows visitors to read the details of each siting.
- Website is hosted at https://coleherman370.github.io/UFOs/

## Summary
A major limitation of this site is the nature of the data. It is static. Meaning that it currently and will allows have the same 111 records. To overcome this limitation, it would be useful to identify other websites with reliable alien siting records. After identifying these sites, a webscraping bot could be deployed to scrap data from them and update the existing table on this webpage. One other useful improvement to this site would be to deploy a second form and table. The second form and table would consist of visitor sitings. The form would allow visitor to log their own sitings while the second table keeps these unconfirmed records separate from the main table. This would allow visitors to the site to see confirmed siting records and also be able to read about other internet visitor personal sitings.
